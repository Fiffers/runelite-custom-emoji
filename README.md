## Custom Emoji
**The filename will become the emoji. For example, `woow.png` means `woow` in-game will show `woow.png`.**

After copying new emojis, the client must restart to apply. 

Type `::emojifolder` in-game chat to open the emoji folder. Otherwise, the folder is located at `.runelite/emoji`

(this website is not endorsed or related to this project, runescape, or runelite. Just the best I found on Google.)

Make sure to right-click save the image (left click saves as BMP file).

## Custom Sound Emojis (Soundoji)

Type `::soundojifolder` in-game chat to open the soundoji folder. Otherwise, the folder is located at `.runelite/soundoji`

File format must be `.wav`. 

**The filename will become the soundoji. For example, `pipe.wav` means `pipe` in-game will play `pipe.wav`.**

# If emoji failed to load
Type `::emojierror` in game to see the errors. If you need help, feel free to leave a ticket here https://github.com/TheLouisHong/runelite-custom-emoji/issues/new
